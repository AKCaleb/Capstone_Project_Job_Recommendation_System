# Capstone Project: Job Recommendation System

Business Understanding\
We aim to address the challenge of job searching by developing a system that simplifies the
process of finding relevant job postings. Our goal is to enhance the job search experience by
making it more efficient and tailored to individual qualifications and preferences.
Having personally experienced the tedious and time-consuming nature of job searching, we
recognize the need for a solution that can streamline this process. By improving the job search
experience, we believe we can benefit both job seekers and recruiters. Job seekers will be able
to quickly find positions that match their skills and interests, while recruiters will have an easier
time identifying suitable candidates for their openings.\
